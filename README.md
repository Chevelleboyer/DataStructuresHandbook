# My Data Structures Handbook

by Chevelle Boyer

This is a summary of the data structures I have mastered. Data structures are a way to efficiently store and organize data. These are important to know because they show an understanding of the actual mechanics. Knowing data structures also proves that given a problem I am equipped with the neccesary tools to solve it in an efficient and practical manner.

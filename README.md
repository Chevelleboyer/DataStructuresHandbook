# My Data Structures Handbook

by Chevelle Boyer

This is a summary of the data structures I have mastered. (More explanation here.
Why is this important? What does this prove to potential employers? How does this
differentiate you from someone who does not know data structures? Why should an
employer care?).

## The List

* [Array](array.md)
* [Tuple](tuple.md)
* [Linked List](linkedlist.md)
* [Stack](stack.md)
* [Queue](queue.md)
* [Deque](deque.md)
* [Graph](graph.md)
* [Tree](tree.md)
* [Dictionary](dictionary.md)
* Set
